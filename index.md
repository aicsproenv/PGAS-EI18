## Overview
The workshop will focus on PGAS (Partitioned Global Address Space) programming model and experiences of the application using PGAS, and the implementation of compiler, runtime and applications.

Its goal is to bring together researchers working in the area of PGAS programming models to parallelize applications, and share the experience using PGAS models. The workshop focuses on PGAS programming languages, tools and libraries with the special focus on experience about the applications developed using this programming model. The workshop is open to any languages and libraries to enables PGAS models. The papers presented practical implementations, scalability and parallelization efficiency are foreseen.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with [HPC Asia 2018](http://sighpc.ipsj.or.jp/HPCAsia2018 "HPC Asia 2018").

## Topics
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
-	PGAS Languages and library implementations and their evaluation,
-	Applications development experience with PGAS programming model,
-	Benchmark suites and performance studies for PGAS programming model,
-	Optimization techniques in PGAS models.
-	PGAS programming model for heterogenous systems,
-	Comparisons between PGAS and other programming models,
-	New solutions such as the integrations with multi-tasking, the design for a new architecture, etc, â€¦
